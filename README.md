# Overview

`bound` is a command line tool with behavior similar to
C++'s
[std::lower_bound](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/lower_bound):
given a string and a file (or stdin), `bound` returns
the first line whose value is greater than or equal to
the given string.

## Delimited lines of input

If the `-f i` option is specified, `bound` returns the
first line whose i-th field is greater than or equal to
the given string.

Fields are delimited by the space character (' ') by
default, but can the delimiter can be specified with
the `-d` option.

## Line number

The line number --- instead of the line itself --- can
be returned with the `-i` option.
